/*Weâ€™re implementing an AI system for our rock, paper, scissors mini - game.
Our AI has to lose every game against the player.
Our AI will know the playerChoice and use it to decide the aiChoice (and
print it).
Take into account that:
* Paper is expressed as 'P' and always beats Rock and loses to Scissors
* Rock is expressed as 'R' and always beats Scissors and loses to Paper
* Scissors is expressed as 'S' and always beats Paper and loses to Rock*/
